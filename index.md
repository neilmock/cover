## Cover Letter

I'm a generalist with over 20 years of experience in software development. No job is too big or too small, and I strive to give accurate assessments of the task at hand at every turn. I hold a degree in Computer Science, and understand theoretical concepts but my core skillset is evaluating projects, scoping the work, and completing in the most efficient and reliable way possible.
