## Cover Letter

Process is predictable but teams are people and people are fluid. Process can't function without people. I work primarly with people and secondarily with process.

Technologies advance faster than companies are able to absorb them. I bring state of the art technology into teams and companies with minimal disruption.

Technologies are both fad and substance, and must be evaluated on the merits relative to the task at hand. 

Company goals and project initiatives turn on a dime and successful teams adapt accordingly. I build systems and processes that anticipate such.

I work primarily in distributed environments, and am versed in its benefits and challenges. 

Above all I believe success is ad-hoc and requires diligence and perserverence. There are no silver bullets.
