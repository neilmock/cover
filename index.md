## Cover Letter

I've been a Clojure enthusiast since first watching Rich Hickey's early "Are We
There Yet?" presentation. At Second Chance Technologies (2CT), Clojure was our
principal language and with a team of two we were able to rapidly prototype and
ship a beta within a few months. Scaling the data pipeline to billions of
records and building out the frontend between two people was a challenge and the
Clojure ecosystem made it possible for us. It is by far the best technology I've
used professionally, and I'm excited by the opportunity to work with both the
language and other "Clojurians" again. Thank you for your consideration.
